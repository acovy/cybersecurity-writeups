## üìù Description
This walkthrough covers the **TCP/IP module** on TryHackMe.  
We explore the **TCP/IP model**, its correspondence with OSI, key protocols, and practical network examples.

> ‚ö° After completing this module, you'll understand how network protocols and their layers function in practice.

## üîπ Introduction
The **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model was developed in the **1970s by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)**.  
One of its main strengths is that a network can continue functioning even when parts of it are down (e.g., during an attack), thanks to adaptive routing protocols.

## üîπ TCP/IP Model Layers
Unlike OSI, the TCP/IP model is often studied **from top to bottom**:

1. **Application Layer**  
   - Combines OSI layers: Application (7), Presentation (6), and Session (5)  
2. **Transport Layer** ‚Äî OSI layer 4  
3. **Internet Layer** ‚Äî OSI layer 3  
4. **Link Layer** ‚Äî OSI layer 2  

### üîπ TCP/IP vs OSI Comparison
| TCP/IP Layer | OSI Layers Covered | Example Protocols |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Application  | 5, 6, 7 | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, POP3, SMTP, IMAP, Telnet, SSH |
| Transport    | 4 | TCP, UDP |
| Internet     | 3 | IP, ICMP, IPSec |
| Link         | 2 | Ethernet 802.3, WiFi 802.11 |
| Physical*    | 1 | ‚Äî |

> \* Many modern textbooks include the physical layer separately, forming a **five-layer TCP/IP model**: Application ‚Üí Transport ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Link ‚Üí Physical.

## üîπ Protocols Overview

### Application Layer
- Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, SSH  
- Function: Provides services directly to applications, handles data, enables communication between end-users  

### Transport Layer
- Examples: TCP, UDP  
- Function: Ensures **end-to-end communication** between applications, handles segmentation, flow control, and error correction  

### Internet Layer
- Examples: IP, ICMP, IPSec  
- Function: Routes packets and provides logical addressing  

### Link Layer
- Examples: Ethernet, WiFi  
- Function: Transfers data within a single network segment
